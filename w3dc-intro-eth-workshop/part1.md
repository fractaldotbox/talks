## Lets build!


---
---


# But I don't know Solidity!

- Basics isn't that hard (mastering it is hard)

<br />

- Build on others' protocol
- Templates & Libraries
- Work with smart contract dev / AI

---

the actual bigger problem:
<br />
What to build?

---
---


# What's "dApp"?
- De-Fi?
- Identity?
- on-chain data & activities?
- on top of some protocol?


## Examples

- [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/)

- [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/)

- [Fileverse](https://fileverse.io/)

<!-- We are going to Dissect -->

## But why dApp?


---
layout: center
---

## Firstly, why blockchain...

---

# Why Blockchain

- Double spending problem
  - Imagine you're buying     od from different stores with a offline phone..
  - OK We have entralized banks or VISA/Master...
  - Ok We don't trust them. Lets decentralize

- BTC = UTXO

What make sense to be on chain?

# Digital Asset

### NFT
- on-chain token (ERC721/1155)
- image usually on IPFS
  - immutable
- censorship resistant

::right::

---
layout: two-cols

# Trustless

### Polymarket as an example
- on-chain prediction market

I trust...
- no one can take away the $ (self-custodial)
- always payout ([Gnosis Conditional Token](https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/) design ensure liquidity)
- honest outcome (enforced by smart contract/oracle)
- censorship resistant (everyone can participate)


~~if:~~
- ~~smart contract don't get hacked~~
- ~~smart accounts don;t get locked~~
- ~~fair resolution at UMA oracle~~

# Back to the Why dApp Q
- Liquidity & Community
- Ecosystems
- New games (mechanisms)

<br />

#### Your call to mix and match
- look at farcaster (decentralized social)
  - not everything "on-chain", separted gossip protocols
- Does a on-chain duolingo make sense?

---
---

<!-- - change trust assumptions
- trustless, transparent 
- enough liqudity -->


<!-- 
- polymarket / trustless
- nft / immutable / ownership  
- autonomous world / agent params and action space
- censorship resistant / tornado cash / someone stop you transfer a to b 
Ofac
- mirror / publishing vs facebook -->

# Lets talk abt something simple

### Swapping on Uniswap...

1. Connect
2. Select on UI
2. (Approve ERC20 allowance)
3. Sign Transaction!
4. Done, Easy! ignoring how AMM works

### Recap: Your account lives on the chain

<!-- - EOA
  - external as in blockchain do not run code in it -->

![alt text](image-30.png)

- you signs transactions for it!

### You signs txn for it!

# in your browser: window.ethereum 



- On [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) with metamask
    - Try in Dev Console "window.ethereum"
    - On incognito?
    - Before & after unlocking metamask?

- [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193)

- Metamask injected the window.ethereum provider

- Try running the sample code in the spec, e.g.

<code>
ethereum
  .request({ method: 'eth_accounts' })

</code>

# What happens under the hood

<!-- ![alt text](image-8.png) -->

# 2 practical types of txn


## Limitations of EOA

### Real world metaphor

Buying a coffee
- Passing your coffee loyalty card to your friend.. OK 
- Passing your whole wallet with all your ATM password.. wait

## Fiat equivalents
- Joint account with spouse (Not financial advice)
- CFO with Company governance / Board of directors 

## Crypto equivalent 
  - Multisig 
  - MPC


---
---


Core intuition is easy

Only with enough points, uniquely determine the curve


### Multisig vs TSS vs MPC
- cost, privacy concern
  - multisig = on-chain 
- upgradability 
  - smart contract upgrade

I want my team to have control..

Navie way

Split password

- not the most secure ways for some obvious reason 
Unfortunately I hv seen that in prod


## Connect vs Sign


- Web2: Login button

- Web3: 
  - Connect: RPC connection. Client shows on-chain wallet  
  - Login: (Sign-in With Ethereum) SIWE. Signatures sent to server




Wallet Connect provider
