# Provider
- The Provider is said to be “connected” when it can service RPC requests to at least one chain.


"A JavaScript object made available to a consumer, that provides access to Ethereum by means of a Client."


"viem"
A Client in the context of viem is similar to an Ethers.js Provider.

"interface to "public" JSON-RPC API"


- "Transport" for EIP1193-provider

## Scaffold - ETH
- https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/#scaffold-eth-2-tech-stack

Hardhat or Foundry (user's choice) for running local networks, deploying and testing smart contracts.
Wagmi for React Hooks to start working with Ethereum.
Viem as low-level interface that provides primitives to interact with Ethereum. The alternative to ethers.js and web3.js.
NextJS for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made hooks.
RainbowKit for adding wallet connection.
DaisyUI for pre-built Tailwind CSS components.
