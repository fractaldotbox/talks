# Who is this for

<br>

This workshop is for developers who want to get started with Web3 dApp development on Ethereuem ecosystems. 

Most importantly, you plan to get your hands dirty, perhaps by participating a hackathon like [ETHGlobalSG](https://ethglobal.com/events/singapore2024) in Sep.   

You're likely either

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Experienced Web2 Developers** - Developer by trade but you have never build on Web3 in production
- üôÜ **Crypto users** - You're native in web3, somewhat technical and trying to learn how things are built 
- üöÄ **Technical Product People** - You don't code much at work but went through basic programming bootcamps, keen to understand more on web3 devs

# Hows this workshop different - Goal

<br />

We know. There are numerous resources online that you can just speedrun.

This in-person workshop try to help you to
- gain momentum, know where to start given your background
- identify key fundamentals and trends
- ask questions to senior industry particioners
- find you hackathon teammates perhaps


---

# Hows this workshop different - Format

<br/>

We think a [Flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) make sense.
- We will send out reading list and leading questions before the workshop.
- Workshop will prioritize showcase and Q&A to guide your future curriculum
- ideally we will see each other during the hackathon

It will be a after-work 4*30mins sessions with food.

To get most out of it, you would have to spend a few hours on the reading lists, tried to follow a few tutorials, have a brief project idea in mind and prepare for questions!

# Guiding Questions


Hopefully you will have better ideas on some of the below questions to continue your dev journey
- When do we want smart contracts for a project?
- What are censorship resistence, provenance, immutability? 
- How do I test against my dapp, without using real $ (Env & Testnets setup)
- How's different to build apps on "L1 vs L2"? 
- What are some notable dApps and how are they being built?
- How can I deploy a smart contract?
- How to improve transactions confirmations UX in Ethereum?
- What are some hackathon projects that are pushing boundaries?

---
---

# What will NOT be covered

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default

```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Draggable Elements

Double-click on the draggable elements to edit their positions.

<br>

###### Directive Usage

```md
<img v-drag="'square'" src="https://sli.dev/logo.png">
```

###### Component Usage

```md
<v-drag text-3xl>
  <carbon:arrow-up />
  Use the `v-drag` component to have a draggable container!
</v-drag>
```

<v-drag pos="663,206,261,_,-15">

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
