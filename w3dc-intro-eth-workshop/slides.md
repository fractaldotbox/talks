# Who is this for

<br>

This workshop is for developers who want to get started with Web3 dApp development on Ethereuem ecosystems. 

Most importantly, you plan to get your hands dirty, perhaps by participating a hackathon like [ETHGlobalSG](https://ethglobal.com/events/singapore2024) in Sep.   

You're likely either

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Experienced Web2 Developers** - Developer by trade but you have never build on Web3 in production
- üôÜ **Crypto users** - You're native in web3, somewhat technical and trying to learn how things are built 
- üöÄ **Technical Product People** - You don't code much at work but went through basic programming bootcamps, keen to understand more on web3 devs

# Hows this workshop different - Goal

<br />

We know. There are numerous resources online that you can just speedrun.

This in-person workshop try to help you to
- gain momentum, know where to start given your background
- identify key fundamentals and trends
- ask questions to senior industry particioners
- find you hackathon teammates perhaps


---

# Hows this workshop different - Format

<br/>

We think a [Flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) make sense.
- We will send out reading list and leading questions before the workshop.
- Workshop will prioritize showcase and Q&A to guide your future curriculum
- ideally we will see each other during the hackathon

It will be a after-work 4*30mins sessions with food.

To get most out of it, you would have to spend a few hours on the reading lists, tried to follow a few tutorials, have a brief project idea in mind and prepare for questions!

# Guiding Questions


Hopefully you will have better ideas on some of the below questions to continue your dev journey
- When do we want smart contracts for a project?
- What are censorship resistence, provenance, immutability? 
- How do I test against my dapp, without using real $ (Env & Testnets setup)
- How's different to build apps on "L1 vs L2"? 
- What are some notable dApps and how are they being built?
- How can I deploy a smart contract?
- How to improve transactions confirmations UX in Ethereum?
- What are some hackathon projects that are pushing boundaries?

---

# What will NOT be covered
- Protocol knowledge except the essential, such as fault proofs, MEV, ZKEVM etc. We recommend materials from https://epf.wiki/
