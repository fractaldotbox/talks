# Premier #1: Maths that sounds complicated

## ü§îDon't know WTF is `Residue class`
<hr />

## üëåBut you know `modular arithmetic` already

- `5 % 3 === 2`

## üëåYou know traits in programming

- Traits/Mixins `implements Vehicle`
  - `move(x:int, y: int)`

- `implements Field`
  - `divide(x: int)-> int`

## Counter Example
- Integers ‚Ñ§ is NOT a field

<br />

## Examples
- Real Numbers ‚Ñù
- Complex Number ‚ÑÇ
  - specifically: as ‚Ñù(i) field extension of ‚Ñù by adjoining _i_.
  - s.t. we have a solution for _i_^2 =1 

- field of modulus prime p...`Prime field`
- which has finite elements....`Finite Field`

# Themes

- We want something hard (to attack)
  - Quantum computing? 

- easy to verify

- Size matters!
   - compact (Field) numbers to do fancy calculations on (via Field extension)


- Vitalik actually wrote very great premiers
  - [Finite field](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/29/binius.html#recap1)
