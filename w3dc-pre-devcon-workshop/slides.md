# Hows this workshop different - Format

<br/>

We think a [Flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) make sense.
- We will send out reading list and leading questions before the workshop.
- Workshop will prioritize showcase and Q&A to guide your future curriculum
- ideally we will see each other during the hackathon

It will be a after-work 3*30mins sessions with food.

To get most out of it, you would have to spend a few hours on the reading lists, tried to follow a few tutorials, have a brief project idea in mind and prepare for questions!

# Who is this for

<br>

Developers who want to get started with Web3 dApp development on Ethereuem ecosystems. 

Who plans to join upcoming Devcon or to get one's hands dirty at [ETHGlobal Bangkok](https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok) hackathon   

You're likely either

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Experienced Web2 Developers** - Developer by trade but you have never build on Web3 in production
- üôÜ **Crypto users** - You're native in web3, somewhat technical and trying to learn how things are built 
- üöÄ **Technical Product People** - You don't code much at work but went through basic programming bootcamps, keen to understand more on web3 devs
